    <div class="speaker-abstract">
	In this talk I'll introduce a multilevel framework for inertial and inexact proximal algorithms, referred as IML FISTA, which includes multilevel adaptations of classical algorithms like forward-backward (FB) and FISTA.

	The proposed IML FISTA is supported by strong theoretical guarantees: we establish both the convergence rate and the convergence of the iterates, a critical outcome for addressing ill-posed problems. We propose a particular instance of IML FISTA, based on the use of the Moreau envelope to build efficient and useful coarse corrections, fully adapted to solve image restoration problems.

	We evaluate our approach on several image reconstruction problems including hyperspectral image restoration. We show that it considerably accelerates the convergence of the corresponding one-level (i.e. FB or FISTA) version of the methods.

	In the context of hyperspectral image restoration, two methods for approximating the objective function dedicated to this problem are proposed. In both cases, the associated convergence guarantees are equivalent to state-of-the-art approaches. These two methods are compared to FISTA, demonstrating the relevance of the proposed approach for very large volumes of data.
